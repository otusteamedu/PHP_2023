## Cycle Detection in Singly-Linked List

### Overview
This section describes the implementation of an algorithm to detect a cycle in a singly-linked list using PHP. The algorithm employs Floyd's Tortoise and Hare method, a widely-used approach for efficiently detecting cycles in linked lists.

### Implementation
The implementation is encapsulated in the `Solution` class within the `hasCycle` method. This method takes a ListNode as input and returns a boolean indicating whether there is a cycle in the list.

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. In the worst-case scenario, every node in the list is visited.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

## Additional Explanation on Recursive Backtracking Algorithm

The process of the recursive backtracking algorithm for generating letter combinations is as follows:

- When the function adds the combination "ae" to the result, the index is 2, indicating the end of the digit string "23". At this point, the function backtracks.
- It returns from the current recursive call (where the last letter was "e" from the digit '3', forming "ae"), which is at the level where `index = 2`.
- The function then moves up to the previous recursion level where `index = 1`. Here, it was iterating through letters corresponding to '3' ("d", "e", "f"). Since "e" was the last letter used, it moves next to "f".
- After exploring all combinations with "a" from '2' and letters from '3' ("ad", "ae", "af"), the function moves up to the level where `index = 0` and the letter is "a".
- At this level, the function iterates to the next letter for the digit '2', which is "b", and descends into the recursion again, forming combinations "bd", "be", "bf" with letters from '3'.
- This depth-first exploration completes all combinations for each letter from the first digit before moving to the next letter and repeating the process.

This systematic approach allows the recursive backtracking algorithm to cover all possible letter combinations for the given digit string.
