The algorithm provided merges two sorted singly-linked lists into a single sorted list. To understand its complexity, let's analyze both its time and space complexity.

### Time Complexity

1. **Traversing the Lists**: The `while` loop continues as long as there are elements in both lists. In the worst-case scenario, this loop iterates a number of times equal to the sum of the lengths of the two lists. This is because, in each iteration, at least one element from one of the lists is processed (either from `list1` or `list2`).

2. **Appending Remaining Elements**: After the `while` loop, there might be some remaining elements in either `list1` or `list2` (but not both). The algorithm appends these remaining elements to the merged list. This operation does not require any additional iterations over the list elements; it's just a pointer assignment. Hence, this part does not significantly affect the time complexity.

Considering these factors, the time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n + m)**, where `n` is the length of `list1` and `m` is the length of `list2`.

### Space Complexity

1. **Extra Space Usage**: The algorithm uses a sentinel node (`$sentinel`) and a few pointers (`$current`, `$list1`, `$list2`). However, it does not create any new nodes; it only rearranges the existing ones. Therefore, the extra space used is constant.

2. **In-place Merging**: Since the algorithm merges the lists by rearranging the existing nodes without allocating any additional nodes, it operates in-place.

Thus, the space complexity of the algorithm is **O(1)**, as it requires a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input list sizes.

In summary, the algorithm is efficient both in terms of time and space, making it an optimal solution for merging two sorted singly-linked lists.
