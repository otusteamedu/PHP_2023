## Getting Started

To launch the project, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sh script.sh
```

This command will set up the environment, including the necessary containers, and execute any initial setup scripts. Once the setup is complete, the project will be accessible through the hostname `application.local`.

Ensure your system's hosts file is configured to redirect `application.local` to the appropriate IP address, typically `127.0.0.1` for local development environments.
