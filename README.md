# Setup and Initialization Instructions

To build the containers and execute the database initialization script, which creates the DDL schema for the cinema management system, run the following command:

\`\`\`bash
sudo sh ./init-db.sh
\`\`\`

This will start all required Docker services and automatically apply the database schema to PostgreSQL.

# ER Diagram

The project includes an ER diagram that outlines the data schema for the cinema management system. The diagram can be found in the file `Cinema_Diagram_Chart.pdf` at the root of the project.
