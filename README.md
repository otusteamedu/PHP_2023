## Cycle Detection in Singly-Linked List

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. In the worst-case scenario, every node in the list is visited.

#### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

## Additional Explanation on Recursive Backtracking Algorithm

### Complexity Analysis

#### Time Complexity
O(4^n), where n is the length of the input string. This represents the maximum number of combinations generated, as each digit can represent up to 4 letters.

#### Space Complexity
O(n), primarily due to the recursion call stack. The depth of the recursion is at most n, where n is the length of the input string.
